Suresh.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm has secured the **third** place out of **28** algorithms in the BBComp competition in GECCO'15.\r\nFor more details, please refer to [this](http://bbcomp.ini.rub.de/results/BBComp2015GECCO/summary.html).\r\n### Quick Demo\r\nFire MATLAB and run the following:\r\n~~~\r\nrunDemo\r\n~~~\r\nThis will walk you through a short demo of NMSO in action optimizing a function in 1-D and 2-D.\r\n\r\n### How to use NMSO\r\n\r\nNMSO has been designed for Black-box Bound-constrained Global Optimization problems. The following would minimize a spherical function whose optimal solution at x=[0.231 0.231] in a 2-D problem space, with the variables being limited to [0,1], using a function evaluation budget of 1000.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nfunc = @(x) sum((x-0.231).^2);\r\ndim = 2;\r\nmaxRange = 1;\r\nminRange = 0;\r\nnumEvaluations = 1000;\r\nftarget = 0;\r\n[yBest,xBest]= NMSO(ftarget, func, numEvaluations, dim, maxRange, minRange, 0);\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nIf you write a scientific paper describing research that made use of this code, please cite the following paper:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n@article{AlDujaili2016b,\r\ntitle = \"A Naive Multi-Scale Search Algorithm for Global Optimization Problems \",\r\njournal = \"Information Sciences \",\r\nvolume = \"\",\r\nnumber = \"\",\r\npages = \" - \",\r\nyear = \"2016\",\r\nnote = \"\",\r\nissn = \"0020-0255\",\r\ndoi = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2016.07.054\",\r\nurl = \"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025516305370\",\r\nauthor = \"Abdullah Al-Dujaili and S.
